## TODO
- allow selection of american or british english?
- after "accept word", it doesn't underline the new selection?
- do something about the en_US dictionary not accepting plural possessives like apes'
- (check possessives of proper names too)
- clicking directly on a red word should immediately select it
- when opening "edit line", cursor should go to first misspelling on the line

## NOT SURE
- "prev" and "next" when at the end should "bounce" once, then do something useful. (Going to next file is problematic...)
- some kind of lasting setting for files to ignore?
- allow a word to be accepted as lowercase? separate button?
- easy way to close all files with no misspellings?
- "correct all" button to fix all occurrences of a misspelled word the same way? Downside: will change words the user can't see.
