## TODO
- allow selection of american or british english?
- after "accept word", it doesn't underline the new selection?
- clicking directly on a red word should immediately select it
- closing the window when there are unsaved changes should prompt a popup

## NOT SURE
- "prev" and "next" when at the end should "bounce" once, then do something useful. (Going to next file is problematic...)
- some kind of lasting setting for files to ignore?
- allow a word to be accepted as lowercase? separate button?
- "correct all" button to fix all occurrences of a misspelled word the same way? Downside: will change words the user can't see.
